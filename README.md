# IoT-weather-station

this project is a device that collects data related to the weather  and environment using different sensors.

The sensors used are: 

- a BMP180 barometric pressure Sensor to measure atmospheric pressure, 

- a DHT11 humidity and temperature sensor to measure humidity and temperature,

- a rain sensor with an LM393 module to measure rainfall.

The following is the hardware design done with Proteus8.
